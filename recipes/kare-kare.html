    <h3>This oxtail kare kare is a richly flavored stew thanks to slow-simmered oxtail.<br>
         The oxtail can be cooked a day ahead, so you can skim off the fat to make the dish a little healthier.<br>
         Using a pressure cooker will reduce the cooking time, but the stew won't be as flavorful. Serve with rice and bago√≥ng (shrimp paste).

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 pounds beef oxtails</li>
        <li>3 cups water, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 beef bouillon cubes</li>
        <li>1/2 pound bokchoy, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 pound long beans, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>1/2 pound eggplant, cubed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon achiote powder</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons smooth peanut butter</li>
        <li><b>MSG!!!</b></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring oxtails and water to a boil in a large pot. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until tender,<br>
            at least 2 hours, adding more water as necessary. Skim as much fat from the top of the liquid as possible.</li>
        <li>Transfer oxtails to a plate. Crumble beef bouillon cubes into the pot and stir to dissolve. <br>
            Add bok choy, beans, and eggplant and simmer until tender, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the vegetables are simmering, heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. <br>
            Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in achiote powder. <br>
            Stir in peanut butter until melted. Add about 1/2 of the simmering broth and simmer for 5 minutes.<br>
            Add oxtails and cook for 5 minutes. Transfer remaining broth and vegetables to the pot and stir to combine. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
